v1.00:
    initial release.
v1.01:
    bufix:   Mascot Parser library apeared to calculat incorrect peptide fragmentation at times, resulting in biased results with Mascot Percolator under certain conditions.
             Work-a-round implemented for Mascot Parser versions <=2.2.0.0
             Bug was reported to Matrix Science and was fixed with Mascot Parser library version >= 2.2.05. The problem was SWIG, which caused premature garbage collection.
    bugfix:  we found that Mascot (in cluster mode only) up to version 2.2.03 calculated the auto decoy search not correctly, resulting in biased Mascot Percolator results.
             Fixed by Matrix Science in Mascot version 2.2.04. Bug #2584 under http://www.matrixscience.com/mascot_support.html#2.2
    new:     simplified command line interface (now only one output file name required).
v1.02:
    feature refinement.
v1.03:
    bugfix: query column in results file were not reported correctly.
v1.04:
    release 1.04 requires Percolator version >= 1.09.
    new:     write Mascot results dat file with -10log10(PosteriorErrorProbabilty) as a Mascot score replacement (-newDat parameter).
    new:     retention time prediction is available as an option now (-rt flag), given the data mgf file contains 'RTINSECONDS' for each spectrum (see http://www.matrixscience.com/help/data_file_help.html)
    new:     xml output instead of tab delimited output available (-xml parameter).
    internal change: switched to new Percolator tab delimited input format.
v1.05 (30/03/2009):
    bugfix:  when a semicolon was used to separate protein identifiers of the same entry (e.g. Prot1;Prot1a), a parser error occurred.
    new:     distributed computing package implemented
    documentation available: http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/analysis/MascotPercolator/
v1.06 (03/04/2009):
    new:     new training feature 'varMods' defined; the number of variable mods divided by all possible variable mods for the peptide at hand
    new:     the parameter 'ranks' is no longer supported and was replaced with 'rankdelta'.
             rankdelta = maximum allowed Mascot score difference between best peptide match (rank 1) and peptide matches of rank 2..10.
             Default = 1: all peptide hit ranks that have a delta Mascot score of < 1 to the top hit match are processed, ideal e.g. to report isobaric peptides etc.
             A setting of -1 strictly reports only the top hit match. Hits of rank 2 and above are only considered if Mascot score > 13.
    new:     the 'newDat' parameter flag now writes also the decoy part of the new dat file. However, this is only available for Mascot Percolator runs that are based on Mascot's Auto-Decoy feature.
    new:     when new dat files are generated, a warning is written into the header: "Result file re-written by Mascot Percolator using scores derived from Percolator PEP values".
    new:     new parameter flag '-features' to save the training data e.g. for debugging purposes.
    bugfix: various users reported some Exceptions that are now handled.
v1.07 (08/05/2009):
    bugfix:  overwrite parameter has appended results to old results file. Fixed.
    bugfix:  queue.Server threw an Exception if a Mascot search result was to be searched that was generated after the queue.Server was started.
    bugfix:  protein feature is now disabled, since we have seen some artefacts on some datasets. This will be further investigated.
    bugfix:  isotope corrected delta mass feature reported incorrect values when charge was 3+.
    bugfix:  delta score now reported without log transformation; before it was always reported as log(deltaScore). Also no more upper maximum that was used as sanity check before.
    new:     the static html page that the queue.Server writes now includes a auto-refresh tag, so the user always sees the latest status.
    new:     if queue.Server scp' dat files to nodes, it sets the permissions of the temporary copy to be 666 (every UNIX user can read/write the file). Make sure you understand the implications.
v1.08 (16/05/2009):
    bugfix:  selection of sub-optimal ranks was biased towards target hits when rankdelta > 0. Now preserving balanced target/decoy set.
    new:     complete re-implementation of queuing system; avoids bi-directional network communication for more stability and reliability.
    new:     config.default.feature file is now part of the distribution. Do not change the file name or content. It presets the Mascot score to be used for the initial SVM training round.
    new:     auto-refresh tag is removed from static html page upon request.
    new:     updated config.properties file.
    bugfix:  reduced memory footprint.
v1.09 (24/06/2009): (basic features identical to 1.08; changes only affect extended feature set)
    update:  refined spectrum processing (top 20 ions per 100mz mass window instead of global 0.1% ion intensity cut-off).
    update:  relative intensities are now reported as % of total intensity.
    update:  sequence coverage feature is removed since redundant with ion coverage when single series are used;
    update:  peptide score feature removed due to strong correlation with Mascot score.
    new:     MS2 mass accuracy is accounted for by median and IQR of MS2 ion mass errors.
    new:     feature implemented longest consecutive series of B+/B++ and Y/Y++ ions.
v1.10 (10/12/2009):
    new:     percolated ion-series are not hardcoded anymore and depend on the Mascot search parameters (instrument). More flexible use.
    bugfix:  if unimod information is not available in the dat files, check for mod_file and throw error if it cannot be found.
V1.11 (30/04/2010):
    note:   James Wright takes over Mascot Percolator Development
    new:    Added charge filtering capability to the MascotROC utility
V1.12 (16/10/2010):
    new:    Added mascotList utility which will list all query top rank hits and their MHT and MIT FDR values
    bugfix: Fix server version to read correctly from percolator v14 output
V1.13
    Minor Bug Fixes
V1.14
    Minor Bug Fixes
V1.15 (05/01/11):
    bugfix: Made new dat writer compatible with Mascot 2.3
    bugfix: file scanner depth increased
    bugfix: rankdelta default set to -1
    new:    Multi database searches are now compatible
V1.16 (01/02/11)
    update: removed individual charge state features and replaced with single charge value
    update: added proteins to MascotList tool
V2.00 (28/02/11)
    update: optional single charge value feature rather than individual features (consider increasing range of individual features?)
    update: Added optional matching of high mass fragments, 3+ and 4+ fragments are calculated and used in fragment matching features
    update: Added spectrum quality filter (option to disable) to remove spectra with low number of peaks
    bugfix: Fix to solve totalMatchedIntensity (and hence relMatchedIntensity) being calculated incorrectly
    bugfix: Fix to make sure each fragment intensity is only considered once in the total matched intensity (consider doing this for individual ion series as well?)
V2.01 (2/11/11)
    bugfix: made server/node compatible with new mascot cluster
